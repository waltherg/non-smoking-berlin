# What is this?

A collection of GeoJSON files with the coordinates of bars, clubs, and other places for a night out
in Berlin that are non-smoking.

Click on one of the .geojson files above and you should see a rendered map with location pins that you can zoom
in and out of.

# Why a list of non-smoking places in Berlin?

I walked into a smoke-filled hair salon today ... so yea.
